To-done is a todo app which aims to actually get your todos done. It does so by creating a single timed, self-destructing todo list for the user. The app was made keeping in mind the capstone project for the Android Nanodegree offered by Google and Udacity. 

## Features

* Timed todo lists
* Minimal to-the-point design
* Persistent notification
* A resizable homescreen widget
* Sleek design based on the Material Design spec
